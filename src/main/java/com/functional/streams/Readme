Java 8 introduces Stream API.

A stream represents a sequence of elements and supports different kind of operations to perform computations upon those elements.

Stream operations are either intermediate or terminal.
    INTERMEDIATE - return a stream (you can chain operations)
    TERMINAL - void/non stream result
