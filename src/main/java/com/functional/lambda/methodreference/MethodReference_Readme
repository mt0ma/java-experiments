In Java 8, thanks to lambda expressions, we can use methods as if they were objects, or primitive values.
Method references help to point to methods by their names.
A method reference is described using :: (double colon) symbol.

A method reference can be used to point the following types of methods −
     Static methods
     Instance methods - of a particular type or of an existing object
     Constructors using new operator (TreeSet::new)



Instead of using AN ANONYMOUS CLASS
you can use A LAMBDA EXPRESSION
And if this just calls one method, you can use A METHOD REFERENCE
