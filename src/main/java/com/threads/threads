Thread - lightweight process; can run in parallel

Threads vs Processes
--------------------

Both processes and threads are independent sequences of execution.
The typical difference is that threads (of the same process) run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.


Thread scheduler in java is the part of the JVM that decides which thread should run.
There is no guarantee that which runnable thread will be chosen to run by the thread scheduler.
Only one thread at a time can run in a single process.
